# :star: MicroserviceGenerator

This application saves developers from boilerplate code
when they attempt to create a new Spring Boot application
with microservice architecture by using Spring Cloud.

In order to create a modern Spring application we need
at least 5 different microservices when we create
a new application;

    - Registry
    - Gateway
    - User
    - Authentication
    - Frontend

The MicroserviceGenerator does the job for you! By giving a configuration file
to the generator in YAML format, MicroserviceGenerator can create the whole
skeleton of your application according to your configuration!
